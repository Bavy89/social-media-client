# Workflow CA



## **About** <a id="about"></a>

This project is part of the Workflow course assignment from Noroff. With aims to improve the quality of an existing environment by establishing useful workflows that make the development process more efficient. The test code is forked from a Noroff example of a social media platform using Noroff's API. I have created Jest and Cypress tests for the required test cases. The repo environment has been configured to have pre-commit checks using Prettier, ESLint and Jest, to ensure code quality is maintained. I have also established branch protections on the main branch. With GitHub action workflows to automatically deploy the main branch to GitHub Pages on merge, and checks that my unit and end to end tests are passing before being allowed to merge into the main branch.
